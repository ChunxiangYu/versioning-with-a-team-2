## Clayton Mercer

I worked as a software engineering intern at LifeOmic during this summer. The technologies I used were React, React Native, and NodeJS as well as many AWS products. Most of the remainder of the summer was time spent with family. It all went very well considering COVID so I can't complain.

 Over the summer i spent most of it at home contributing to open source projects especially a lot of client extensions like facecheck for League of Legends. I even spent time helping with other web apps that are open to contribution.
